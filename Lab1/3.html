        <h1>The best song ever</h1>

        <h2>by MIKA "Grace Kelly"</h2>

        <p>Hello my baby, hello my baby, putting my life on my brink
            Why don't you like me, why don't you like me? Why don't you like yourself?
            Should I bend over, should I look older, just to be put on your shelf?
            I tried to be like Grace Kelly, mmh
            But all her looks were too sad, aah
            So I tried a little Freddie, mmh
            I've gone identity mad!
            I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky
            I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like
            Gotta be green, gotta be mean, gotta be everything more
            Why don't you like me, why don't you like me?
            Walk out the door!</p>
